## Jianbo Dai

<font size="4">
I am an Artificial Interlligen MSc student in Univerisity of Edinburgh where I learned machine learning and natural language processing. Previously, I had bachelors in University of Manchester and Dalian Unversity of Technology but majored in Chemical Engineering.
Now I am luckily supervised by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/">Sharon Golderwater</a> for my master project on Morphological Analysis. My research interests fall in semantic parsing.
