I am an Artificial Interlligen MSc student in Univerisity of Edinburgh where I learned machine learning and natural language processing. Previously, I had bachelors in University of Manchester and Dalian Unversity of Technology but majored in Chemical Engineering.
Now I am luckily supervised by Sharon Golderwater and doing my master project on Morphological Analysis. My research interests fall in semantic parsing.
