input = "Lemmatization in natural language processing area is a task to return associated lemmawhen  given  its  inflected  words.   Nowadays,  researchers  focus  on  using  neural  models  todeal  with  this  task,  such  as  adding  context  representations  in  input.   In  this  proposal,we introduced a possible way to enhance existed neural contextualized sequence-to-sequencemodels by incorporating copy mechanism, which can selectively replicate some parts in inputand generate them in output, thus adding an intermediate stage in basic encoding-decodingprocess.  In addition, we will also investigate whether using exclusive context representationsfor languages with the same morphological typology can help lemmatization.  The estimatedduration for this work is about 10 weeks"
