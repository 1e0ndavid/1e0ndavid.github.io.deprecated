input = "Lemmatization in natural language processing area is a task to return associated lemma when given its inflected words. Nowadays, researchers focus on improving neural models to deal with this task, such as adding context representations in input. In this proposal, we introduced a possible way to enhance existed neural contextualized sequence-to-sequence models by incorporating copy mechanism, which can selectively replicate some parts in input and generate them in output, thus adding an intermediate stage in basic encoding-decoding process. We will also investigate whether using exclusive context representations for languages with the same morphological typology can help lemmatization. Hopefully, this work can be a guideline to incorporate copying mechanism in neural lemmatization and benefit downstream tasks."
